# IBM-MQ-Docker-performance

Author: [Roman Kharkovski](http://kharkovski.blogspot.com/).

This project is created to automate the testing of IBM MQ (formerly WebSphere MQ) in a Docker environment. The installation, provisioning, configuration, optimizations of MQ settings and test runs are all automated using bash scripts.

This project is very similar to the MQ on "native" performance test described [in this blog post](https://advantage.ibm.com/2015/03/12/ibm-mq-vs-apache-activemq-performance-comparison-update/)
